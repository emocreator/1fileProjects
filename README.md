#Cute and Amusing 1 file Small Projects in Python, C++, R, and Rust
In this repository, I've gathered a collection of small yet cute projects written in Python, C++, R, and Rust. These projects are not only fun to explore but also showcase the unique features and capabilities of each language. Let's dive in and see what each project has to offer!

Sudoku Solver Using Backtracking

```
Start with an initial Sudoku board that has some cells pre-filled with numbers.
Find an empty cell on the board.
Place a number (1-9) in the empty cell if it is a valid move according to Sudoku rules (i.e., the number does not appear in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid).
Continue filling the board by recursively applying the backtracking procedure. If the board is completely filled and valid, the puzzle is solved.
If the current number in the empty cell leads to an invalid or unsolvable board, remove the number from the cell (i.e., set the cell value back to 0), and try the next number.
If none of the numbers (1-9) can be placed in the current empty cell, backtrack to the previous cell and try another number there.
Repeat steps 2-6 until the puzzle is solved or all possibilities are exhausted.
```

Stochastic Search.

```
Initialize the board with the given numbers.
Randomly select an empty cell on the board.
Randomly select a number (1-9) and place it in the selected cell if it is a valid move according to Sudoku rules.
Continue steps 2-3 until the board is filled and the puzzle is solved, or until a certain number of iterations have been reached.
If the puzzle is not solved after a certain number of iterations, reset the board to its initial state and start over.
